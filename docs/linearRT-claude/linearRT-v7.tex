\begin{abstract}
    This article presents a detailed linear stability analysis of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability occurring at the interface between two immiscible, inviscid fluid layers of different densities. The system consists of two fluids separated by a horizontal interface, with rigid boundaries at the top and bottom. We derive the governing equations from first principles, solve for the velocity field in both fluid regions, and establish the dispersion relation that determines the stability of the system. The effects of surface tension and finite fluid depth are incorporated into the analysis. We find that the system is unstable when the heavier fluid overlies the lighter fluid, unless sufficiently strong surface tension is present. The complete mathematical description of the velocity field is provided, which can serve as a foundation for further investigations into the nonlinear development and fractal characteristics of the evolving interface.

\section{Introduction}
The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) is a fundamental fluid instability that occurs when a denser fluid is supported by a lighter fluid against gravity \citep{rayleigh1882, taylor1950}. This instability plays a crucial role in numerous natural and engineered systems, from supernovae explosions to inertial confinement fusion. The interface between the two fluids develops characteristic structures that evolve into increasingly complex patterns, eventually exhibiting fractal-like properties \citep{sharp1984, youngs1991}.

Understanding the linear stability of the RTI is the first step in analyzing its more complex nonlinear development. In this article, we present a comprehensive linear stability analysis of two immiscible, inviscid fluid layers separated by a horizontal interface, incorporating the effects of surface tension and finite fluid depth.

The results of this analysis provide the mathematical foundation for studying the evolution of the interface, which can later be analyzed using fractal dimension measurements such as the box-counting method. This approach is particularly useful for quantifying the multi-scale structures that develop during the nonlinear phase of the instability.

\section{Problem Formulation}
\subsection{Geometric Configuration}
We consider two immiscible, inviscid fluids each having a constant, but different density occupying a space between two horizontal planes. The interface between the fluids is initially parallel to the bounding planes forming a horizontal plane. We establish a coordinate system such that the $z$-axis is vertical and the interface lies in the $x$-$y$ plane at $z = 0$. The top boundary is at $z = H_t$ and the bottom at $z = -H_b$, with the boundaries being $H_b + H_t$ apart.

Constant gravitational acceleration acts in the $-z$ direction with magnitude $g$. The bottom fluid (fluid 1) has density $\rho_1$, and the top fluid (fluid 2) has density $\rho_2$. Initially, the fluid is at rest.

\subsection{Governing Equations}
For small-amplitude perturbations, the linearized equations for inviscid, incompressible flow are:
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} &= 0 \\
\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} &= -\nabla p + \rho \mathbf{g}
\end{align}

Taking the curl of the momentum equation eliminates the pressure gradient:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) = 0
\end{equation}

This implies that in initially irrotational flow, the flow remains irrotational:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = 0
\end{equation}

For irrotational flow, we can introduce a velocity potential $\phi$ such that $\mathbf{v} = \nabla \phi$. The incompressibility condition then becomes the Laplace equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi = 0
\end{equation}

For normal mode analysis, we consider perturbations of the form:
\begin{equation}
\phi(x,y,z,t) = \Phi(z)e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \omega t)}
\end{equation}

Substituting into the Laplace equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\Phi}{dz^2} - k^2\Phi = 0
\end{equation}

where $k^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2$.

The vertical velocity component is $w = \partial\phi/\partial z$, which satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2 w}{dz^2} - k^2 w = 0, \quad -H_b < z < H_t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Boundary Conditions}
The boundary conditions for this problem are:

1. At the rigid boundaries, the vertical velocity must vanish:
\begin{align}
w_1(-H_b) &= 0 \\
w_2(H_t) &= 0
\end{align}

2. At the interface, the vertical velocity must be continuous:
\begin{equation}
w_1(0) = w_2(0) = w_0
\end{equation}

3. The pressure balance at the interface, accounting for surface tension $T$, yields:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_0(\rho D(w)) = -\frac{k^2}{\omega^2}[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]w_0
\end{equation}

where $D() = d/dz$ and $\Delta_0(f) = [f(z+0) - f(z-0)]_{z=0}$.

\section{Solution Methodology}
\subsection{General Solution for Vertical Velocity}
The general solution to the differential equation $\frac{d^2 w}{dz^2} - k^2 w = 0$ is:
\begin{equation}
w(z) = Ae^{kz} + Be^{-kz}
\end{equation}

Applying this form to each fluid region:

For fluid 1 ($-H_b < z < 0$):
\begin{equation}
w_1(z) = A_1e^{kz} + B_1e^{-kz}
\end{equation}

For fluid 2 ($0 < z < H_t$):
\begin{equation}
w_2(z) = A_2e^{kz} + B_2e^{-kz}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Application of Boundary Conditions}
Applying the boundary condition $w_1(-H_b) = 0$:
\begin{equation}
A_1e^{-kH_b} + B_1e^{kH_b} = 0
\end{equation}

This gives:
\begin{equation}
A_1 = -B_1e^{2kH_b}
\end{equation}

Substituting back:
\begin{equation}
w_1(z) = B_1(e^{-kz} - e^{2kH_b+kz})
\end{equation}

Similarly, applying $w_2(H_t) = 0$:
\begin{equation}
A_2e^{kH_t} + B_2e^{-kH_t} = 0
\end{equation}

This gives:
\begin{equation}
A_2 = -B_2e^{-2kH_t}
\end{equation}

Substituting back:
\begin{equation}
w_2(z) = B_2(e^{-kz} - e^{-2kH_t+kz})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interface Conditions and Dispersion Relation}
From the continuity condition $w_1(0) = w_2(0) = w_0$:
\begin{align}
B_1(1 - e^{2kH_b}) &= w_0 \\
B_2(1 - e^{-2kH_t}) &= w_0
\end{align}

This gives:
\begin{align}
B_1 &= \frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}} \\
B_2 &= \frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}
\end{align}

Computing the derivatives at the interface:
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{dw_1}{dz}\right|_{z=0} &= -kB_1(1 + e^{2kH_b}) \\
\left.\frac{dw_2}{dz}\right|_{z=0} &= -kB_2(1 + e^{-2kH_t})
\end{align}

Applying the pressure balance condition:
\begin{equation}
\rho_2\left.\frac{dw_2}{dz}\right|_{z=0} - \rho_1\left.\frac{dw_1}{dz}\right|_{z=0} = -\frac{k^2}{\omega^2}[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]w_0
\end{equation}

Substituting the derivatives and rearranging:
\begin{equation}
-k\rho_2\frac{1 + e^{-2kH_t}}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}w_0 + k\rho_1\frac{1 + e^{2kH_b}}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}w_0 = -\frac{k^2}{\omega^2}[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]w_0
\end{equation}

Simplifying with the hyperbolic cotangent function:
\begin{equation}
\rho_2\coth(kH_t) + \rho_1\coth(kH_b) = \frac{k}{\omega^2}[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]
\end{equation}

Solving for $\omega^2$:
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \frac{k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}
\end{equation}

\section{Complete Velocity Field Solution}
\subsection{Vertical Velocity Components}
The vertical velocity components in each fluid region are:

For fluid 1 ($-H_b < z < 0$):
\begin{equation}
w_1(z) = \frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} - e^{2kH_b+kz})
\end{equation}

For fluid 2 ($0 < z < H_t$):
\begin{equation}
w_2(z) = \frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} - e^{-2kH_t+kz})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Horizontal Velocity Components}
From the incompressibility condition and irrotationality:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} &= 0
\end{align}

For perturbations of the form $e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \omega t)}$:
\begin{align}
ik_xu + ik_yv + \frac{dw}{dz} &= 0 \\
ik_yu - ik_xv &= 0 \\
ik_xw - \frac{du}{dz} &= 0 \\
ik_yw - \frac{dv}{dz} &= 0
\end{align}

From these relations:
\begin{align}
u &= -i\frac{k_x}{k^2}\frac{dw}{dz} \\
v &= -i\frac{k_y}{k^2}\frac{dw}{dz}
\end{align}

Applying to each fluid region:

For fluid 1:
\begin{align}
u_1(z) &= i\frac{k_x}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} + e^{2kH_b+kz}) \\
v_1(z) &= i\frac{k_y}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} + e^{2kH_b+kz})
\end{align}

For fluid 2:
\begin{align}
u_2(z) &= i\frac{k_x}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} + e^{-2kH_t+kz}) \\
v_2(z) &= i\frac{k_y}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} + e^{-2kH_t+kz})
\end{align}

\subsection{Time-Dependent Solution}
The complete time-dependent solution is:

For fluid 1 ($-H_b < z < 0$):
\begin{align}
w_1(x,y,z,t) &= \frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} - e^{2kH_b+kz})e^{i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t)} \\
u_1(x,y,z,t) &= i\frac{k_x}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} + e^{2kH_b+kz})e^{i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t)} \\
v_1(x,y,z,t) &= i\frac{k_y}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} + e^{2kH_b+kz})e^{i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t)}
\end{align}

For fluid 2 ($0 < z < H_t$):
\begin{align}
w_2(x,y,z,t) &= \frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} - e^{-2kH_t+kz})e^{i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t)} \\
u_2(x,y,z,t) &= i\frac{k_x}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} + e^{-2kH_t+kz})e^{i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t)} \\
v_2(x,y,z,t) &= i\frac{k_y}{k}\frac{w_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} + e^{-2kH_t+kz})e^{i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t)}
\end{align}

\section{Stability Analysis}
\subsection{Stability Criterion}
The stability of the system is determined by the sign of $\omega^2$ in the dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \frac{k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}
\end{equation}

Since the denominator $\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)$ is always positive (as both $\coth(kH_b)$ and $\coth(kH_t)$ are positive for positive arguments), the sign of $\omega^2$ is determined by the numerator $g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T$.

The system is stable ($\omega^2 > 0$) when:
\begin{equation}
g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T < 0
\end{equation}

This occurs in two scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When $\rho_2 < \rho_1$ (heavier fluid on bottom), the term $g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)$ is negative, ensuring stability regardless of surface tension.
    \item When $\rho_2 > \rho_1$ (heavier fluid on top), stability requires that surface tension be sufficiently large: $k^2T > g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)$.
\end{enumerate}

The system is unstable ($\omega^2 < 0$) when:
\begin{equation}
g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \rho_2 > \rho_1
\end{equation}

In this case, perturbations grow exponentially with time according to $e^{\gamma t}$, where $\gamma = \sqrt{-\omega^2}$ is the growth rate.

\subsection{Cutoff Wavenumber}
When $\rho_2 > \rho_1$, there exists a cutoff wavenumber $k_c$ above which the system is stable due to surface tension:
\begin{equation}
k_c = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)}{T}}
\end{equation}

Perturbations with $k > k_c$ are stable, while those with $k < k_c$ are unstable. This indicates that surface tension stabilizes short-wavelength perturbations, while long-wavelength perturbations can still grow.

\subsection{Most Unstable Mode}
The growth rate as a function of wavenumber is:
\begin{equation}
\gamma(k) = \sqrt{\frac{k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}}
\end{equation}

To find the most unstable mode, we need to determine where $\frac{d\gamma}{dk} = 0$. Let's define $f(k) = \gamma^2(k)$ to simplify:
\begin{equation}
f(k) = \frac{k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}
\end{equation}

Taking the derivative with respect to $k$:
\begin{align}
\frac{df}{dk} &= \frac{1}{D^2}\left\{[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T - 2k^2T]D - k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]\frac{dD}{dk}\right\} \\
&= \frac{1}{D^2}\left\{[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - 3k^2T]D - k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]\frac{dD}{dk}\right\}
\end{align}

where $D = \rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)$ and $\frac{dD}{dk} = -\rho_1 H_b \cdot \text{csch}^2(kH_b) - \rho_2 H_t \cdot \text{csch}^2(kH_t)$.

Setting $\frac{df}{dk} = 0$ and solving for $k$ gives the most unstable mode. In the general case, this requires solving:
\begin{multline}
[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - 3k^2T][\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)] + \\
k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T][\rho_1 H_b \cdot \text{csch}^2(kH_b) + \rho_2 H_t \cdot \text{csch}^2(kH_t)] = 0
\end{multline}

The derivative of the growth rate $\gamma$ with respect to $k$ is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\gamma}{dk} = \frac{1}{2\gamma} \cdot \frac{df}{dk}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Special Cases}
For specific cases, we can find analytical solutions:

\paragraph{Deep Fluid Limit:} When $kH_b, kH_t \gg 1$, we have $\coth(kH_b) \approx \coth(kH_t) \approx 1$ and $\text{csch}^2(kH_b) \approx \text{csch}^2(kH_t) \approx 0$. The equation simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - 3k^2T](\rho_1 + \rho_2) = 0
\end{equation}

Solving for $k$:
\begin{equation}
k_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)}{3T}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Equal Depths:} When $H_b = H_t = H$, the equation still requires numerical solution except in limiting cases.

\paragraph{Shallow Fluid Limit:} When $kH_b, kH_t \ll 1$, we have $\coth(kH) \approx \frac{1}{kH}$ and the equation becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{df}{dk} \approx \frac{[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - 3k^2T][\frac{\rho_1}{kH_b} + \frac{\rho_2}{kH_t}] - k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T][-\frac{\rho_1}{k^2H_b} - \frac{\rho_2}{k^2H_t}]}{[\frac{\rho_1}{kH_b} + \frac{\rho_2}{kH_t}]^2}
\end{equation}

After simplification and solving for $k_{max}$, we find that in the shallow fluid limit, the most unstable wavenumber can be approximated as:
\begin{equation}
k_{max} \approx \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)}{5T}}
\end{equation}

This indicates that in shallow fluid layers, the most unstable wavelength is longer compared to the deep fluid case.

\section{Rayleigh-Taylor Instability in a Finite Domain}
We now extend our analysis to consider the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a domain that is finite in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Specifically, we consider a rectangular domain defined by:
\begin{align}
0 \leq x \leq L, \quad -\infty < y < \infty, \quad -H_b \leq z \leq H_t
\end{align}

\subsection{Modified Normal Mode Analysis}
With the introduction of a finite horizontal dimension, the perturbation modes must satisfy the boundary conditions at $x = 0$ and $x = L$. For free-slip conditions (where the normal velocity component vanishes at the walls), the appropriate normal modes are:
\begin{align}
w(x,y,z,t) &= W(z)\cos(k_n x)e^{ik_y y - i\omega t} \\
u(x,y,z,t) &\sim \sin(k_n x) \\
v(x,y,z,t) &\sim \cos(k_n x)
\end{align}

where $k_n = \frac{n\pi}{L}$ and $n$ is a positive integer. This represents the quantization of the wavenumber in the $x$-direction due to the finite domain size.

\subsection{Vertical Structure and Dispersion Relation}
The differential equation for $W(z)$ remains:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2W}{dz^2} - k^2W = 0
\end{equation}

but now with $k^2 = k_n^2 + k_y^2 = \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2 + k_y^2$.

Following the same solution procedure as in the infinite horizontal domain case, we apply the boundary conditions:
\begin{align}
W_1(-H_b) &= 0 \\
W_2(H_t) &= 0 \\
W_1(0) &= W_2(0) = W_0
\end{align}

The solutions for the vertical velocity components are:
\begin{align}
W_1(z) &= \frac{W_0}{1 - e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz} - e^{2kH_b+kz}) \\
W_2(z) &= \frac{W_0}{1 - e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz} - e^{-2kH_t+kz})
\end{align}

The interface condition involving pressure balance yields the dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \frac{k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T]}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}
\end{equation}

where $k^2 = \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2 + k_y^2$.

\subsection{Complete Velocity Field}
The complete velocity field for this finite domain problem is:

Vertical velocity:
\begin{align}
w_1(x,y,z,t) &= \frac{W_0}{1-e^{2kH_b}}(e^{-kz}-e^{2kH_b+kz})\cos(k_n x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \quad \text{for } -H_b < z < 0 \\
w_2(x,y,z,t) &= \frac{W_0}{1-e^{-2kH_t}}(e^{-kz}-e^{-2kH_t+kz})\cos(k_n x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \quad \text{for } 0 < z < H_t
\end{align}

Horizontal velocities:
\begin{align}
u_1(x,y,z,t) &= -\frac{W_0 k_n}{k(1-e^{2kH_b})}(e^{-kz}+e^{2kH_b+kz})\sin(k_n x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \quad \text{for } -H_b < z < 0 \\
u_2(x,y,z,t) &= -\frac{W_0 k_n}{k(1-e^{-2kH_t})}(e^{-kz}+e^{-2kH_t+kz})\sin(k_n x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \quad \text{for } 0 < z < H_t
\end{align}

\begin{align}
v_1(x,y,z,t) &= -i\frac{W_0 k_y}{k(1-e^{2kH_b})}(e^{-kz}+e^{2kH_b+kz})\cos(k_n x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \quad \text{for } -H_b < z < 0 \\
v_2(x,y,z,t) &= -i\frac{W_0 k_y}{k(1-e^{-2kH_t})}(e^{-kz}+e^{-2kH_t+kz})\cos(k_n x)e^{ik_y y-i\omega t} \quad \text{for } 0 < z < H_t
\end{align}

\subsection{Stability Analysis for Finite Domain}
The stability criterion remains $\omega^2 < 0$ for instability, which occurs when:
\begin{equation}
g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T > 0
\end{equation}

With the quantized wavenumber $k^2 = \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2 + k_y^2$, this leads to a mode-dependent stability condition. The most unstable mode corresponds to $n = 1$ and $k_y = 0$, giving the condition:
\begin{equation}
g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) > \left(\frac{\pi}{L}\right)^2 T
\end{equation}

This defines a critical length:
\begin{equation}
L_c = \pi\sqrt{\frac{T}{g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)}}
\end{equation}

For $L < L_c$, the system is stable for all modes due to surface tension effects.

\subsection{Special Case: Zero Surface Tension}
An important special case to consider is when $T = 0$, representing negligible surface tension between the fluids. This simplification has significant implications for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dispersion Relation}: The dispersion relation reduces to:
    \begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = \frac{k g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Stability Criterion}: The system is stable only when $\rho_2 < \rho_1$ (heavier fluid on bottom) and always unstable when $\rho_2 > \rho_1$ (heavier fluid on top).
    
    \item \textbf{No Cutoff Wavenumber}: Without surface tension, there is no cutoff wavenumber. The instability exists for all wavelengths when $\rho_2 > \rho_1$.
    
    \item \textbf{Growth Rate Behavior}: The growth rate increases monotonically with $k$, meaning that the shortest wavelengths grow most rapidly, leading to an ill-posed mathematical problem in the continuous case.
    
    \item \textbf{Finite Domain Effects}: In the finite domain case, all modes are unstable when $\rho_2 > \rho_1$, with no critical domain length.
    
    \item \textbf{Contact Angle Effects}: With $T = 0$, contact angle boundary conditions become irrelevant since there's no surface tension to create a contact angle.
\end{enumerate}

In numerical simulations with zero surface tension, growth would be limited only by grid resolution, and the interface would develop extremely complex structures very quickly across all resolvable scales.

\subsection{Implementation in Numerical Simulations}
When implementing the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in numerical simulations, the selection of appropriate initial conditions is crucial. Based on the linear stability analysis, the following guidelines apply:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Wavenumber Selection}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $T = 0$ (no surface tension): Any real value of $k$ can be used, though the growth rate increases with $k$.
        \item For $T > 0$ (with surface tension): Only wavenumbers $k < k_c = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}{T}}$ will lead to unstable growth, with the most unstable mode at $k = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}{3T}}$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Domain Size Considerations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In finite domains with length $L$, the horizontal wavenumber is quantized as $k_x = \frac{n\pi}{L}$.
        \item To ensure at least one unstable mode, the domain size must satisfy $L > \frac{\pi}{k_c} = \pi\sqrt{\frac{T}{g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}}$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Initial Perturbation Amplitude}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The linear stability analysis is valid for small amplitude perturbations.
        \item In practice, an amplitude of 1-5\% of the wavelength is typically suitable.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple Mode Initialization}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Real systems typically contain a spectrum of modes.
        \item Initializing with multiple modes can provide more realistic development.
        \item The relative amplitudes can be chosen based on a physical spectrum or to emphasize particular modes of interest.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Practical Wavenumber Selection}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{First Problem (Infinite Horizontal Domain):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{With Surface Tension ($T > 0$):} 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Select wavenumbers in the range $0 < k < k_c = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}{T}}$.
                    \item Focus especially on $k \approx k_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}{3T}}$ as this represents the most unstable mode.
                    \item Include a range of values around $k_{max}$ (e.g., $0.7k_{max}$ to $1.3k_{max}$) to observe the actual most unstable mode.
                    \item For a complete study, sample wavenumbers from near zero up to just below the cutoff $k_c$.
                \end{itemize}
                \item \textit{Without Surface Tension ($T = 0$):}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item In principle, the growth rate increases indefinitely with $k$, but numerical simulations require finite resolution.
                    \item Choose wavenumbers based on the computational grid resolution, e.g., $k_{min} = \frac{2\pi}{L_{domain}}$ to $k_{max} = \frac{\pi}{\Delta x}$, where $\Delta x$ is the grid spacing.
                    \item For physical relevance, include wavenumbers that correspond to wavelengths observed in experiments.
                    \item A practical approach is to initialize with a spectrum of wavenumbers with amplitude scaling as $A_k \propto k^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha \approx 1-2$ gives physically reasonable results.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            
        \item \underline{Bounded Horizontal Domain:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{With Surface Tension ($T > 0$):}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The horizontal wavenumbers are quantized as $k_x = \frac{n\pi}{L}$, $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$
                    \item Ensure that at least the $n=1$ mode is unstable by choosing $L > \pi\sqrt{\frac{T}{g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}}$.
                    \item Calculate the maximum unstable mode number $n_{max}$ by solving $\frac{n_{max}\pi}{L} < k_c$.
                    \item Initialize with modes $n = 1$ to $n = n_{max}$, with emphasis on the mode closest to $k_{max}$.
                    \item When $k_y$ is also considered, ensure that the total wavenumber $k = \sqrt{(\frac{n\pi}{L})^2 + k_y^2}$ remains below $k_c$.
                    \item For domains with aspect ratio near unity, the most important modes to include are those with small $n$ and small $k_y$.
                \end{itemize}
                \item \textit{Without Surface Tension ($T = 0$):}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item All modes $k_x = \frac{n\pi}{L}$ are unstable.
                    \item In practice, initialize with a range of modes up to a maximum $n$ determined by numerical resolution.
                    \item Higher-$n$ modes grow faster, so depending on simulation duration, focus on either:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Low-$n$ modes for long-time evolution studies (as these will eventually develop complex structures)
                        \item A spectrum including higher-$n$ modes for studies focused on early rapid growth
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item For 2D simulations with $k_y = 0$, use the $n$ values directly.
                    \item For pseudo-3D with non-zero $k_y$, combine discrete $k_x = \frac{n\pi}{L}$ with a selection of $k_y$ values.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            
        \item \underline{Contact Angle Considerations:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item When contact angles are included, the allowed wavenumbers are solutions to transcendental equations.
                \item For practical implementation:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Solve the transcendental equation numerically to find the allowed $k$ values.
                    \item Pre-calculate these values before the simulation starts.
                    \item Ensure the initial perturbation satisfies the contact angle boundary conditions.
                    \item For small contact angles (near 90°), the free-slip approximation can be used without significant error.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Velocity Field Initialization}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The initial velocity field can be set using the eigenfunctions derived in the linear analysis.
        \item For a specified interface perturbation $\eta(x,y,0)$, the corresponding velocity components can be calculated from the solutions in Sections 3 and 4.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

For studying fractal development, it's particularly useful to initialize with a spectrum of modes below the cutoff wavenumber, as this will lead to complex multi-scale structures developing naturally through the instability mechanism.

\section{Effects of Contact Angle at Lateral Boundaries}
We now incorporate the effects of surface tension at the lateral boundaries, where the fluid-fluid interface meets the solid walls at $x = 0$ and $x = L$. This addition provides a more realistic representation of experimental and computational setups, as real interfaces form specific contact angles with solid boundaries.

\subsection{Contact Angle Formulation}
At a solid boundary, the fluid-fluid interface forms a contact angle $\theta$ determined by the balance of interfacial tensions according to Young's equation:
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{SG} - \gamma_{SL} = \gamma_{LG}\cos\theta
\end{equation}

where $\gamma_{SG}$, $\gamma_{SL}$, and $\gamma_{LG}$ are the solid-gas, solid-liquid, and liquid-gas interfacial tensions, respectively. In our two-fluid system, the equivalent relation involves the surface tensions between the solid and each fluid, and the tension at the fluid-fluid interface.

\subsection{Boundary Conditions with Contact Angle}

Let us represent the interface perturbation as $\eta(x,y,t)$, describing the deviation of the interface from the equilibrium position at $z = 0$. For small perturbations, the linearized boundary condition at the walls incorporating the contact angle $\theta$ is:
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0} &= -\cot\theta_0 \\
\left.\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right|_{x=L} &= \cot\theta_L
\end{align}

where $\theta_0$ and $\theta_L$ are the contact angles at $x = 0$ and $x = L$, respectively. The contact angles can be different at each wall depending on the surface properties.

\subsection{Modified Normal Mode Analysis}
The boundary conditions for the contact angle modify our normal mode structure. Instead of simple cosine modes, we must use a more general form:
\begin{equation}
\eta(x,y,t) = [A\cos(kx) + B\sin(kx)]e^{ik_y y - i\omega t}
\end{equation}

Applying the contact angle boundary conditions:
\begin{align}
-kA\sin(0) + kB\cos(0) &= -\cot\theta_0 \\
-kA\sin(kL) + kB\cos(kL) &= \cot\theta_L
\end{align}

This gives:
\begin{align}
kB &= -\cot\theta_0 \\
-kA\sin(kL) + kB\cos(kL) &= \cot\theta_L
\end{align}

Substituting the first equation into the second:
\begin{align}
-kA\sin(kL) - \cot\theta_0\cos(kL) &= \cot\theta_L \\
kA\sin(kL) &= -\cot\theta_0\cos(kL) - \cot\theta_L
\end{align}

This leads to a transcendental equation for the wavenumbers $k$:
\begin{equation}
\cot\theta_0\cos(kL) + \cot\theta_L = -k\cdot A\sin(kL)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Special Case: Symmetric Contact Angles}
If the contact angles are the same at both walls ($\theta_0 = \theta_L = \theta$), we can simplify by considering symmetric and antisymmetric modes separately.

For symmetric modes ($A \neq 0$, $B = 0$):
\begin{align}
\eta(x,y,t) &= A\cos(kx)e^{ik_y y - i\omega t} \\
\left.\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0} &= -kA\sin(0) = 0 \\
\left.\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right|_{x=L} &= -kA\sin(kL) = \cot\theta
\end{align}

This gives the condition:
\begin{equation}
\sin(kL) = -\frac{\cot\theta}{kA}
\end{equation}

For antisymmetric modes ($A = 0$, $B \neq 0$):
\begin{align}
\eta(x,y,t) &= B\sin(kx)e^{ik_y y - i\omega t} \\
\left.\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0} &= kB\cos(0) = -\cot\theta \\
\left.\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right|_{x=L} &= kB\cos(kL) = \cot\theta
\end{align}

This gives:
\begin{align}
kB &= -\cot\theta \\
kB\cos(kL) &= \cot\theta
\end{align}

Which leads to:
\begin{equation}
\cos(kL) = -1
\end{equation}

This is satisfied when $kL = (2m-1)\pi$ for integer $m$.

\subsection{Kinematic Boundary Condition and Velocity Field}
The kinematic boundary condition relates the interface perturbation to the velocity field:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = w(x,y,0,t)
\end{equation}

For our normal mode analysis:
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\eta = w(x,y,0,t)
\end{equation}

The vertical velocity at the interface must be consistent with our modified normal modes. For the contact angle boundary conditions, this gives:
\begin{equation}
w(x,y,0,t) = -i\omega[A\cos(kx) + B\sin(kx)]e^{ik_y y - i\omega t}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Modified Dispersion Relation}
The presence of contact angles at the walls modifies both the allowed wavenumbers and potentially the dispersion relation. The pressure balance at the interface now includes additional terms related to the curvature induced by the contact angle constraints:
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \frac{k[g(\rho_2 - \rho_1) - k^2T] - \Gamma(k,\theta_0,\theta_L)}{\rho_1\coth(kH_b) + \rho_2\coth(kH_t)}
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma(k,\theta_0,\theta_L)$ represents the additional contribution from the wall effects. This term depends on the specific form of the normal modes that satisfy the contact angle boundary conditions.

\subsection{Implications for Stability}
The contact angle effects have several important implications for stability:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mode Selection}: The transcendental equation for $k$ constrains the allowed wavenumbers, which may differ from the simple $k_n = \frac{n\pi}{L}$ of the free-slip case.
    
    \item \textbf{Stabilization or Destabilization}: Depending on the contact angles, wall effects can either stabilize or destabilize the system. For contact angles less than 90°, there is typically a stabilizing effect as the interface resists deformation near the walls.
    
    \item \textbf{Critical Domain Size}: The critical length $L_c$ for instability is modified by the contact angle constraints and may be larger or smaller than in the free-slip case.
    
    \item \textbf{Growth Rate Modification}: The growth rates of unstable modes are affected, particularly for modes with wavelengths comparable to the distance from the walls.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Static Meniscus Effects}
Even in the absence of Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the contact angle creates a static meniscus near the walls. For a vertically oriented interface with contact angle $\theta$, the static meniscus profile is described by:
\begin{equation}
z(x) = \ell_c\sqrt{2(1-\cos\phi)} \approx \ell_c\phi^2
\end{equation}

where $\ell_c = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho g}}$ is the capillary length, and $\phi$ is related to the contact angle. The static meniscus extends a distance of approximately $3\ell_c$ from the wall. For typical fluids, this can be on the order of millimeters to centimeters.

The presence of this static meniscus creates a background state upon which the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops, potentially affecting the growth and morphology of the instability near the walls.

\subsection{Numerical Implementation Considerations}
For numerical simulations with contact angle effects, several implementation aspects are important:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Contact Line Treatment}: The numerical treatment of the contact line (where the interface meets the wall) requires special consideration, as it represents a singularity in the mathematical model.
    
    \item \textbf{Mesh Refinement}: Higher mesh resolution is typically needed near the walls to accurately resolve the static meniscus and the dynamics of the interface in these regions.
    
    \item \textbf{Contact Angle Hysteresis}: In real systems, contact angles often exhibit hysteresis, with different advancing and receding angles. This can be incorporated in more sophisticated models.
    
    \item \textbf{Initial Conditions}: Simulations should ideally start from the correct static meniscus profile rather than a flat interface to avoid spurious dynamics.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implications for Fractal Analysis}
The presence of contact angle effects has significant implications for fractal analysis of the evolving interface:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Boundary Layer Effects}: Near the walls, the interface dynamics are dominated by contact angle constraints, potentially exhibiting different scaling properties than in the bulk.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-fractal Behavior}: The interface may exhibit multi-fractal behavior, with different fractal dimensions near the walls compared to the bulk region.
    
    \item \textbf{Characteristic Length Scales}: The capillary length $\ell_c$ introduces an additional characteristic length scale that can affect the range over which fractal scaling is observed.
    
    \item \textbf{Analysis Methodology}: For accurate fractal dimension measurements, it may be necessary to analyze different regions of the interface separately, particularly excluding the wall regions.
\end{enumerate}

This extended analysis provides a more complete and realistic model of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in finite domains, particularly for comparison with laboratory experiments and numerical simulations where wall effects are inevitable.

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a comprehensive linear stability analysis of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for two immiscible, inviscid fluid layers separated by a horizontal interface. The complete velocity field solution has been derived for both infinite and finite horizontal domains, and the stability criteria have been established.

The key findings are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system is stable when the heavier fluid is on the bottom ($\rho_2 < \rho_1$).
    \item When the heavier fluid is on top ($\rho_2 > \rho_1$), the system is unstable unless surface tension is sufficiently strong.
    \item Surface tension stabilizes short-wavelength perturbations, creating a cutoff wavenumber $k_c = \sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_2 - \rho_1)}{T}}$.
    \item Finite fluid depth provides additional stabilization compared to the semi-infinite case.
    \item In a finite horizontal domain, only discrete modes can grow, and there exists a critical domain size below which the system is stable for all modes.
    \item Contact angle effects at the lateral boundaries modify the allowed wavenumbers and can either stabilize or destabilize the system depending on the specific angles.
    \item Wall effects create boundary layers near the walls where the interface dynamics may differ significantly from the bulk behavior, with important implications for fractal analysis.
\end{enumerate}

This analysis provides the mathematical foundation for further investigations into the nonlinear development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and its fractal characteristics. The box-counting method can be applied to the evolving interface to quantify its increasing complexity, providing insights into the multi-scale nature of this fundamental fluid instability, while accounting for the important effects of finite domain size and wall interactions.
