Now here is the question you've been waiting for.  Can either or both the temporal or resolution codes be parallelized? Each time step result is independent, right...
Edit

Absolutely! You've hit the nail on the head! üéØ

Yes, both can be parallelized because:

    ‚úÖ Each timestep analysis is completely independent
    ‚úÖ Each resolution analysis is completely independent
    ‚úÖ No shared state between analyses
    ‚úÖ Only file I/O dependencies (which are read-only)

Current State

    temporal_evolution_analyzer.py: ‚ùå Sequential only
    simple_resolution_comparison.py: ‚ùå Sequential only
    resolution_benchmark_optimized.py: ‚úÖ Already has parallel support (but was buggy)

Parallelization Benefits

Temporal Evolution (biggest gains):

bash

# Sequential: 50 timesteps √ó 0.8s = 40 seconds
# Parallel (4 cores): 50 timesteps √∑ 4 √ó 0.8s = 10 seconds
# 4√ó speedup potential!

Resolution Comparison (moderate gains):

bash

# Sequential: 4 resolutions √ó 1.5s = 6 seconds  
# Parallel (4 cores): 4 resolutions √∑ 4 √ó 1.5s = 1.5 seconds
# 4√ó speedup, but smaller absolute time savings

Implementation Options
1. Quick Win: Simple Parallel Temporal Evolution

python

from multiprocessing import Pool

def analyze_single_timestep(vtk_file):
    # Analyze one timestep independently
    return result

# Parallel execution
with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
    results = pool.map(analyze_single_timestep, vtk_files)

2. Controlled Parallelism (Recommended)

    Process 4-8 files simultaneously
    Prevents I/O bottlenecks
    Memory management for large datasets

3. Hybrid Approach

    Parallel for temporal evolution (many files)
    Sequential for resolution comparison (few files, but complex)

Want me to implement parallel versions?

I can create:

    Parallel Temporal Evolution Analyzer - biggest performance gain
    Fix the existing parallel resolution benchmark - already partially implemented
    Both with smart resource management

The temporal evolution parallelization would give you the biggest benefit since you're processing 50+ timesteps. Which would you like me to tackle first?

Be sure to add the word parallel to their names, but please create the 2 and fix the third.
Edit

Perfect! I'll create the parallel versions with clear naming. Let me start with the parallel temporal evolution analyzer:

Now let me create the parallel resolution comparison analyzer:

Finally, let me fix the existing resolution benchmark:

Perfect! Now you have three parallel analysis tools:
1. parallel_temporal_evolution_analyzer.py

üöÄ Best for temporal studies - Biggest speedup potential

bash

# Process 50 timesteps in parallel
python3 parallel_temporal_evolution_analyzer.py \
  --data-dir ~/Research/svofRuns/Dalziel/200x200 \
  --resolution 200 \
  --max-timesteps 50 \
  --processes 6

2. parallel_resolution_comparison.py

üöÄ Clean parallel resolution comparison

bash

# Compare multiple resolutions in parallel
python3 parallel_resolution_comparison.py \
  --data-dirs ~/Research/svofRuns/Dalziel/200x200 ~/Research/svofRuns/Dalziel/400x400 ~/Research/svofRuns/Dalziel/800x800 \
  --resolutions 200 400 800 \
  --target-time 3.0 \
  --processes 3

3. resolution_benchmark_optimized.py (FIXED)

üõ†Ô∏è Fixed the existing parallel benchmark

    Fixed the "string indices must be integers" error
    Simplified the analysis workflow
    Better error handling and result validation

Key Parallel Features

‚úÖ Smart Process Management: Auto-detects CPU count, limits to prevent I/O saturation
‚úÖ Progress Tracking: Shows real-time progress during parallel execution
‚úÖ Performance Metrics: Reports speedup, efficiency, and theoretical performance
‚úÖ Error Resilience: Individual failures don't crash entire analysis
‚úÖ Memory Efficient: Each process handles its own analysis independently
Expected Performance Gains

Temporal Evolution (50 timesteps):

    Sequential: ~40 seconds
    Parallel (4 cores): ~12 seconds
    3-4√ó speedup!

Ready to test the parallel versions? Start with the temporal evolution analyzer on a subset of your data to see the performance gains!

I need to copy these first.  Know that my laptop has only 2 cores while my desktop at home has 16
Edit

Perfect! Good to know your hardware specs. Here's how to optimize for each:
For Your Laptop (2 cores)

bash

# Use 2 processes (matches your core count)
python3 parallel_temporal_evolution_analyzer.py \
  --data-dir ~/Research/svofRuns/Dalziel/200x200 \
  --resolution 200 \
  --max-timesteps 20 \
  --processes 2

# Expected: ~1.8√ó speedup (not quite 2√ó due to I/O overhead)

For Your Desktop (16 cores)

bash

# Use 6-8 processes (sweet spot to avoid I/O bottlenecks)
python3 parallel_temporal_evolution_analyzer.py \
  --data-dir ~/Research/svofRuns/Dalziel/200x200 \
  --resolution 200 \
  --max-timesteps 100 \
  --processes 8

# Expected: ~6-7√ó speedup for large temporal studies!

Auto-Detection

If you don't specify --processes, the scripts will auto-detect:

    Laptop: Will use 2 processes automatically
    Desktop: Will cap at 8 processes (to prevent I/O saturation) even though you have 16 cores

Copy Strategy

Since you're copying the files, create them as:

    parallel_temporal_evolution_analyzer.py
    parallel_resolution_comparison.py
    Update your existing resolution_benchmark_optimized.py with the fixes

The temporal evolution analyzer will give you the biggest gains, especially on your 16-core desktop for processing many timesteps! üöÄ

Take your time copying them - the parallel speedups will be worth it!

would you print out the full resolution_benchmark code?
Edit

There's the complete fixed resolution_benchmark_optimized.py code! The key fixes include:
Main Fixes Applied

    Fixed the "string indices must be integers" error with proper error handling
    Simplified workflow - removed complex grid caching that was causing issues
    Safe dictionary access with .get() methods to prevent key errors
    Better error reporting - shows exactly which step failed
    Enhanced result validation - ensures results are dictionaries before processing
    Improved plotting - filters out NaN values before plotting to prevent crashes

Key Changes

    Line 89-150: Completely rewritten analyze_single_resolution_optimized() function
    Line 274-320: Enhanced error handling in the plotting section
    Added: Safe dictionary access throughout
    Added: Better progress reporting and error messages

This version should work reliably with your fixed rt_analyzer.py and provide the same parallel resolution comparison functionality, but without the crashes you were experiencing before.

Ready to test all three parallel scrip
