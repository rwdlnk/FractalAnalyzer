# Dalziel Mixing Layer Theory and Implementation

## Physical Setup

**Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Configuration:**
- Heavy fluid (density ρ₁) initially on top
- Light fluid (density ρ₀) initially on bottom  
- Initial interface at z = 0 (Dalziel coordinates)
- Atwood number: A = (ρ₁ - ρ₀)/(ρ₁ + ρ₀)
- Dimensionless time: τ = t√(Ag/H)

**Concentration Field:**
- c₁(x,z,t) = local fraction of heavy fluid (0 ≤ c₁ ≤ 1)
- c₁ = 1: pure heavy fluid
- c₁ = 0: pure light fluid  
- c₁ = 0.5: equal mixture

## Dalziel's Mixing Thickness Definitions

### Notation Convention
- First subscript: fluid type (1 = heavy fluid, 0 = light fluid)
- Second subscript: region (1 = above interface, 0 = below interface)

### Equations 6 & 7: Mixing-Weighted Penetration

**Heavy fluid above interface (Eq. 6):**
```
h₁,₁ = ∫₀^∞ ∫₋∞^∞ c₁(x,z,t)[1-c₁(x,z,t)] dx dz
```

**Heavy fluid below interface (Eq. 7):**
```
h₁,₀ = ∫₋∞^0 ∫₋∞^∞ c₁(x,z,t)[1-c₁(x,z,t)] dx dz
```

### Physical Interpretation of c₁(1-c₁) Integrand

**Mixing Intensity Function:**
- c₁(1-c₁) = 0 when c₁ = 0 or c₁ = 1 (pure fluids, no mixing)
- c₁(1-c₁) = 0.25 when c₁ = 0.5 (maximum mixing, 50-50 mixture)
- c₁(1-c₁) weights regions by their degree of mixing

**What This Measures:**
The integrand c₁(1-c₁) identifies and weights regions where **actual mixing** has occurred, rather than simple fluid penetration. This distinguishes between:

1. **Unmixed penetration**: Heavy fluid finger penetrating but remaining pure (c₁ ≈ 1) → contributes ≈ 0
2. **True mixing**: Regions with intermediate concentrations (0.2 < c₁ < 0.8) → significant contribution
3. **Light fluid regions**: Pure light fluid (c₁ ≈ 0) → contributes ≈ 0

## Alternative Interpretation: Simple Penetration

**Mass-Based Penetration (your current approach):**
```
h₁,₁^(mass) = ∫₀^(H/2) c̄₁(z,t) dz
h₁,₀^(mass) = ∫₋(H/2)^0 c̄₁(z,t) dz
```

Where c̄₁(z,t) = (1/L)∫₀^L c₁(x,z,t) dx is the horizontally-averaged concentration.

**Physical Meaning:**
- h₁,₁^(mass): Total amount of heavy fluid above initial interface (mixed + unmixed)
- h₁,₀^(mass): Total amount of heavy fluid below initial interface (mixed + unmixed)

## Key Differences Between Methods

| Method | Integrand | Physical Meaning | Weighting |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Dalziel** | c₁(1-c₁) | Mixing-weighted penetration | Emphasizes mixed regions |
| **Mass-based** | c₁ | Total fluid penetration | Counts all fluid equally |

### Example Comparison
Consider a heavy fluid finger with c₁ = 0.9 penetrating into light fluid:

- **Dalziel weight**: 0.9 × (1-0.9) = 0.09 (low contribution)
- **Mass weight**: 0.9 (high contribution)

The Dalziel method "discounts" this penetration because it represents invasion without significant mixing.

## Implementation in Your Code

### Method 1: Dalziel's Mixing-Weighted (Equations 6-7)
```python
def compute_dalziel_mixing_weighted(self, data, h0):
    """Compute h₁,₁ and h₁,₀ using c₁(1-c₁) weighting"""
    
    # Get concentration field and coordinates
    f = data['f']  # Your concentration field (heavy fluid fraction)
    y_values = data['y'][0, :]  # y-coordinates
    x_values = data['x'][:, 0]  # x-coordinates
    
    # Transform to Dalziel coordinates (z = y - h0)
    z_values = y_values - h0
    
    # Grid spacing
    dx = np.abs(np.diff(x_values)[0])
    dz = np.abs(np.diff(z_values)[0])
    
    # Compute mixing intensity: c₁(1-c₁)
    mixing_intensity = f * (1.0 - f)
    
    # Split domain at interface
    above_interface = z_values > 0
    below_interface = z_values < 0
    
    # Dalziel h₁,₁: mixing-weighted heavy fluid above interface
    if np.any(above_interface):
        region_above = mixing_intensity[:, above_interface]
        h_11_dalziel = np.sum(region_above) * dx * dz
    else:
        h_11_dalziel = 0.0
    
    # Dalziel h₁,₀: mixing-weighted heavy fluid below interface  
    if np.any(below_interface):
        region_below = mixing_intensity[:, below_interface]
        h_10_dalziel = np.sum(region_below) * dx * dz
    else:
        h_10_dalziel = 0.0
    
    return {
        'h_11_dalziel': h_11_dalziel,
        'h_10_dalziel': h_10_dalziel,
        'h_11_normalized': h_11_dalziel / (0.5 * H),  # For comparison with Fig 14
        'h_10_normalized': h_10_dalziel / (0.5 * H),
        'method': 'dalziel_mixing_weighted'
    }
```

### Method 2: Mass-Based Penetration (Your Current Approach)
```python
def compute_mass_based_penetration(self, data, h0):
    """Compute h₁,₁ and h₁,₀ using simple mass integration"""
    
    # Horizontal average
    f_avg = np.mean(data['f'], axis=0)
    y_values = data['y'][0, :]
    
    # Transform to Dalziel coordinates
    z_values = y_values - h0
    dz = np.abs(np.diff(z_values)[0])
    
    # Split domain at interface
    above_interface = z_values > 0
    below_interface = z_values < 0
    
    # Mass-based h₁,₁: total heavy fluid above interface
    if np.any(above_interface):
        h_11_mass = np.sum(f_avg[above_interface]) * dz
    else:
        h_11_mass = 0.0
    
    # Mass-based h₁,₀: total heavy fluid below interface
    if np.any(below_interface):
        h_10_mass = np.sum(f_avg[below_interface]) * dz
    else:
        h_10_mass = 0.0
    
    return {
        'h_11_mass': h_11_mass,
        'h_10_mass': h_10_mass,
        'h_11_normalized': h_11_mass / (0.5 * H),
        'h_10_normalized': h_10_mass / (0.5 * H),
        'method': 'mass_based_penetration'
    }
```

## Expected Differences in Results

**Hypothesis for Your Data (τ ≈ 2.0):**

1. **Mass-based method** will give larger values because it counts all heavy fluid penetration
2. **Dalziel's method** will give smaller values because it emphasizes only well-mixed regions
3. **Figure 14 agreement** should be better with Dalziel's mixing-weighted approach

**Physical Reasoning:**
At τ ≈ 2.0, RT instability likely shows significant penetration with varying degrees of local mixing. Heavy fluid fingers may penetrate deep but remain relatively unmixed, leading to:
- High mass-based h₁,₁ (counts the fingers fully)
- Lower Dalziel h₁,₁ (discounts unmixed finger cores)

## Validation Strategy

1. **Implement both methods** and compare results
2. **Plot mixing intensity** c₁(1-c₁) to visualize where mixing occurs
3. **Compare temporal evolution** of both measures against Figure 14
4. **Resolution study** to ensure grid independence

This dual approach will help determine which interpretation of Dalziel's method matches their experimental results and provides insight into the physics of RT mixing.
